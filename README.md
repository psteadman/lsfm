## Results as of 2017-09

Test set of 2x2 and 3x3 works with 0.18 overlap.

There is something off about the math in doing the overlap and stitching which has yet to reveal its self to my eyes...

For real data I have tried and had mixed results. To some extent test set 2 appears to work with overlap set at 0.22 instead of 0.2. I can not get test set 1 or 3 to work in a satisfactory way.
