I should create a circle image and then cut it myself with known overlap this will create a true test set. 

I have a 512 x 512 image that I will split to make a test case. If I want the image overlap to be 20% what should be the dimensions of each tile for that image?
I did the split by 10%, so each image gets 10% extra of half so total overlap space should be 20%. Though the stitching only works properly if I use overlap of 18%. I cant figure out why.
